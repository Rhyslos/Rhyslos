## Hi there!
My name is Yuna 
I am a final-year student specializing in **Multimedia Technology and Design**.

I am currently finishing my degree, with a strong focus on software architecture and interactive applications. While I am building web applications today, my long-term ambition is to become skilled enough to work full-time as a **.NET Developer**.

### Current Projects

**Bachelor Project: Kanban Web App**
I am currently developing a full-featured Kanban board application for students using **JavaScript**. This project focuses on taking notes, drag-and-drop logic, and UI responsiveness.

**Pomodoro App**:
My final course that isn't the bachelor project is making an app with Node.JS. I've decided to make a Pomodoro application where you can make tasks in sync with other people, and then have a shared work session.

**Game Development (Side Projects)**
I use **Godot** with the **.NET framework (C#)** for my personal projects.

### Technical Skills

* **Languages:** C# (.NET), JavaScript, HTML, CSS
* **Engines:** Godot Engine and Unreal Engine
* **3D Design:** Animation, Modelling, Texturing
* **Tools:** Git, Visual Studio, 3Ds Max, Cinema 4D, Blender, Davinci Resolve

### Personal & Interests

When I step away from the keyboard, I focus on a few specific interests:

* **Photography:** I am a massive camera gear geek. I love the technical side of photography as much as the composition.
* **Tea:** I am a dedicated tea enthusiast.
* **Opinions:** I firmly believe cats are vastly superior to dogs.
